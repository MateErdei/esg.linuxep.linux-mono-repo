In order to run these tests in tap do from local machine or CI portal:
 1) activate the tap environment:
    source tap/bin/activate
 2) tap run edr_plugin --debug-loop                         #run the pytests and robot tests
 3) tap run edr_plugin.componentt --debug-loop              #runs the pytests only
 4) tap run edr_plugin.integration --debug-loop             #runs the robot tests only

  #runs both pytests and robot for bullseye coverage, the branch must have a coverage build.
  #     master or branches end with 'coverage'

 5) tap run edr_plugin.coverage --debug-loop
 6) Working with CI portal
      a) Build portal for EDR - manually produce a coverage on CI
        choose -> "Build with Parameters" and set mode = coverage
      b) Test Pipeline for EDR - manually run coverage on any branch with a valid build
        choose -> "Build with Parameters" -> coverage = yes
