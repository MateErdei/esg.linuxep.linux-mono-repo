In order to run these tests in tap do from local machine or CI portal:
 1) activate the tap environment:
    source tap/bin/activate
 2) tap run edr_plugin --debug-loop                         #run the pytests and robot tests
 3) tap run edr_plugin.componentt --debug-loop              #runs the pytests only
 4) tap run edr_plugin.integration --debug-loop             #runs the robot tests only

  #runs both pytests and robot for bullseye coverage, the branch must have a coverage build.
  #     develop or branches end with 'coverage'

 5) tap run edr_plugin.coverage --debug-loop
 6) Working with CI portal
      a) Build portal for EDR - manually produce a coverage on CI
        choose -> "Build with Parameters" and set mode = coverage
      b) Test Pipeline for EDR - manually run coverage on any branch with a valid build
        choose -> "Build with Parameters" -> coverage = yes

Unified pipeline
1) Fetch build inputs as specified in release xml
    tap fetch edr_plugin
2) build edr on local machine
    tap run edr_plugin.build --build-backend=local
3) build edr on local machine and run tests
    export TAP_PARAMETER_MODE=mode -> one of "release|analysis"
    tap run edr_plugin --build-backend=local
4) run tests on branch with unified pipelie build
    export TAP_PARAMETER_MODE=mode -> one of "release|coverage"
    tap run edr_plugin
5) Run tap test on branch with classic pipline build.
    unset TAP_PARAMETER_MODE (if its set)
    tap run edr_plugin... (usual options are optional)
