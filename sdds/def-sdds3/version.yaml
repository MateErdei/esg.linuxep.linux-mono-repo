# This file contains the base version for all suites built in this branch/build.
#
# What does this mean?
#
# It means a consistent approach to versioning across all suites.
#
# The suite versions now follow a predictable pattern:
#
#     MAJOR.MINOR.AUTOVER[.INSTANCE?].NONCE
#
# WTF does that mean? Let's break those parts down and describe how they change.
#
#     {MAJOR.MINOR}  -> set by humans for each release
#
#                 {AUTOVER[.INSTANCE?].NONCE}  -> set by the build system
#
# The build system generates the following extra fields:
#
# * AUTOVER: Generated by `versioning_client -c {mode}_suite_{suite} -v {major.minor}`,
#   where {mode} is `prod` or `dev`; and {suite} is the name of the suite.
# * INSTANCE: If the suite has multiple instances, this is a unique integer for each.
# * NONCE: A unique checksum to make suite names hard to predict.
#
# Examples!
#
# When version.major is set to `2022.1`, and version.minor is set to `0`, the build produces
# the following suites (where 9999 is an auto-incrementing number):
#
# * sdds3.WindowsCloudEncryption_2022.1.0.9999.<nonce>.dat
#                                ^^^^^^^^_________________ the major.minor version
#                                         ^^^^____________ the autover is 9999; no instances
#                                              ^^^^^^^____ the nonce
#
# * sdds3.WindowsCloudHitmanProAlert_2022.1.0.9999.0.<nonce>.dat
# * sdds3.WindowsCloudHitmanProAlert_2022.1.0.9999.1.<nonce>.dat
#                                    ^^^^^^^^___________________ the major.minor version
#                                             ^^^^______________ the autover is 9999
#                                                  ^____________ the instances are 0 & 1
#                                                    ^^^^^^^____ the nonce
#
# And so on.
#
# For sprint builds, you additionally define version.sprint, which changes the
# generated marketing versions.

version:
  major: 2023.1       # increment this for each major release
  minor: 0            # increment this for each "planned" minor release

  # For sprint builds, specify the sprint; automatically used in suite marketing versions
  # For non-sprint release builds, just comment this out or use 'null'
  sprint: '2022.45'
