         *
         *  @see https://wiki.sophos.net/display/SophosCloud/Endpoint+Management+Protocol
         *
         *  From the point of view of the Management Console an endpoint will have App installed ( for example, SAV, ALC, HBT, etc).
         *  Each App is required to be able to understand its Policy and provide feedback via Status.
         *  Some Apps also support Actions.
         *
         *  For the design of this product, the Plugins are managed by the Management Agent and their status, policies and actions go to and come from
         *  Management Console indirectly via this Management Agent.
         *
         *  The IPluginApi aims to simplify the interaction and facilitate the development of Plugins in the product, implementing
         *  all the ipc communication between the Plugin and the Agent and exposing a simple API for Plugins developers.
         *
         *  The Plugin is to be created by IPluginResourceManagement and it requires for its creation to be given also the IPluginCallback which defines the
         *  services that a Plugin must provide to the Management Agent.
         *
         *  The common case will be that there will be a one-to-one map between the Plugin and the Management Console App representation. But there are scenario
         *  that a Plugin may want to implement functionalities of two Apps or that two Plugins colaborate to implement a single App. For this reason,
         *  ::sendEvent and ::changeStatus and ::getPolicy require that the appId must be provide explicitly.
