## Please note that these tests rely on the files in InstallSet being upto date. To regenerate these run
## an install manually and run the generateFromInstallDir.sh from InstallSet directory.
## WARNING
## If you generate this from a local build please make sure that you have blatted the distribution
## folder before remaking it. Otherwise old content can slip through to new builds and corrupt the
## fileset.
##
## ALTERNATIVELY ##
## Run the commented out *test* above ("Get Fileset"). Open the report and copy the logged "DirectoryInfo",
## "FileInfo", and "SymbolicLinkInfo" into their respective files in the installset and use a find and
## replace with regex enabled to swap \|\| for \n
