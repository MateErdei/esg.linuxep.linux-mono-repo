*** Test Case ***
Plugin Entry That Can Not Be Read Should Not Break Other Plugins
    Create Directory   ${SOPHOS_INSTALL}/base/pluginRegistry/plugin.json
    Start System Watchdog
    Run Telemetry Executable     ${EXE_CONFIG_FILE}     ${SUCCESS}
    # directory will be ignored for the other executables reading pluginRegistry
    Wait Until Keyword Succeeds
    ...  30 secs
