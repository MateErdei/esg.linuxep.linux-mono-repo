--- kcov ---
kcov is a code coverage checking utility that we have built a cmake target for. This runs against the google tests.
The cmake target executes the run-kcov*.sh scripts within this directory.
Example usage:
cd in your debug build dir
make

To run a particular test:
TEST=watchdog/watchdogimpl/TestWatchdog make kcov

To run all the unit tests:
make kcov-all
