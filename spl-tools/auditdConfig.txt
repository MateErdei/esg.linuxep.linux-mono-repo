## Values we have changed

max_log_file = 5
# changed from 8MB > 5MB max log file size

num_logs = 2
# Changed number of logs kept from 5 to 2. One being written to, and the previously filled. The oldest file is replaced by by the file being written to when it reaches the max_log_file size

flush = INCREMENTAL_ASYNC
freq = 100
# freq changed from 50 > 50. An explicit buffer flush will be issued when 100 logs have been written. A bigger freq value means this happens less often. 100 is the recommended value by redhat.
